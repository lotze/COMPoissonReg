\maketitle

To include a PDF vignette that is compiled from a plain LaTeX file,
all you need is the LaTeX file with LaTeX comments containing
meta directives to R such that it will be listed as a vignette in the
package.
The LaTeX-based vignette file should be placed in the
\code{vignettes/} directory of your package.  If your LaTeX file
includes other files such as figure files, these should also be
located in the \file{vignettes/}.
For instance, this PDF document was compiled from LaTeX file:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item \code{vignettes/R\_packages-LaTeX\_vignettes.ltx}
\end{enumerate}
%
which contains the following meta directives at the top of the file:
%
\begin{CodeInput}[numbers=left,xleftmargin=5mm]
%\VignetteIndexEntry{R packages: LaTeX vignettes}
%\VignetteEngine{R.rsp::tex}
%\VignetteKeyword{R}
%\VignetteKeyword{package}
%\VignetteKeyword{vignette}
%\VignetteKeyword{LaTeX}
\end{CodeInput}
%
Here I choose filename extension \code{*.ltx}, which is a lesser known LaTeX
filename extension, because if one uses \code{*.tex}, then \code{R CMD check}
will give a NOTE complaining that the file is a stray file that should not be
part of the built package.

Also, the above first two entries are required whereas the keyword
entries are optional.  Note also that the
\code{\%{\bs}VignetteIndexEntry\{\}} controls the title shown in R's
help indices as well as in online package respositories such as CRAN. 

As for any type of (non-Sweave) package vignette, don't forget to specify:
%
\begin{CodeInput}
Suggests: R.rsp
VignetteBuilder: R.rsp
\end{CodeInput}
%
in your package's DESCRIPTION file.  That's all it takes to include a
LaTeX file that will be compiled into a PDF vignette as part of the
package build.
